            Hi ! <br>
            My name is Jurgita, but friends call me Julie as I am from Lithuania and most of the names are difficult to
            pronounce, so feel free to call me Julie!
            So litte bit about myself:<br>
            I'm 32 years old and live in Liverpool,UK for 11 years now.
            On my spare time I like to spend time with my friends or trying new recepies, reading books, going for a
            walk
            when weather allows or watch good series on netflix or amazon prime.<br>


            Why frontend you may ask? <br>

            Year of 2019, when we had to go on furlough due to coronavirus outbreak (yes, that 'C' word..) I was worried
            that
            I might not comeback to my job, so I started to look around how I could avoid being in this vurnerable
            position.

            <br>
            I had looked around and came accros frontend development and was surprised how much I liked it.
            I took decision to take further steps and started learning HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT with LearningPeople.<br>

            It just a beginning, but I already love what I do!
